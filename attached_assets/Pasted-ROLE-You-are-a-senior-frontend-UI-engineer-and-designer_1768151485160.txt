ROLE:
You are a senior frontend UI engineer and designer. Your task is to transform this website’s UI into a modern, clean, premium, SaaS-style layout using a **white background and navy blue accents**. 

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT change any text content.
- Do NOT change the logo.
- Do NOT remove, rename, or reorder any sections.
- All content must remain exactly the same.
- All links, CTAs, and headings remain unchanged.
- All text must be fully readable (opacity = 1, no light colors on white).

GOAL:
Make the website visually **premium, interactive, and modern**, with clear hierarchy, breathing space, subtle motion, and professional styling. Use **dark navy blue as the primary color** for headings, cards, buttons, dividers, and hover effects.

STEPS:

1. COLORS
- Background: #FFFFFF
- Headings (all levels): #0F2A44 (dark navy)
- Body text: #1E293B (slate navy)
- Accent text, labels, icons: #0F2A44
- Muted text: #475569
- Cards: white background with subtle navy border (#E6ECF4)
- Buttons: solid dark navy background (#0F2A44), hover to slightly darker navy (#1E3A8A)
- Links: navy (#0F2A44), hover darker navy

2. SPACING & LAYOUT
- Add generous vertical spacing between sections
- Align text and cards neatly in a grid layout
- Cards and feature sections should have subtle shadows
- Maintain breathing space around headings, buttons, and images
- Ensure visual hierarchy is clear: headings bold, body text readable

3. CARDS & FEATURES
- Each service/expertise card: white background, navy border, rounded corners
- On hover: scale slightly (1 → 1.03) + border accent in navy
- Use subtle drop shadows, not gradients or glows
- Icons in cards: navy-colored

4. HERO SECTION
- Headline: bold, dark navy, fully readable
- Subheadline: slate navy, readable
- CTA buttons: dark navy background, white text, hover darker navy
- Add a **large abstract/3D geometric image** on one side, with navy tones
- Layout: text left, image right (or vice versa), balanced

5. ABOUT SECTION
- Text blocks aligned left or right, matching hero spacing
- Supporting illustration on the opposite side
- Illustration: abstract / modern / geometric style, navy-themed
- Cards/statistics: white background, navy borders, subtle hover animation

6. PROCESS SECTION
- Step-by-step cards (01–06)
- Cards: white, navy border, rounded corners
- Hover: scale + subtle navy highlight
- Optional connector lines between steps: navy

7. IMAGES & VISUALS
- All visuals should match **premium tech-style abstract designs**
- Hero: large 3D or abstract illustration in navy/white
- Expertise cards: small geometric icons
- Process steps: small icons or abstract shapes
- Contact section: subtle visual (illustration, geometric shape) in navy
- Images should support layout, not overpower content
- Use placeholders or Unsplash-style URLs if necessary

8. ANIMATIONS & INTERACTIONS
- Scroll reveal: translateY(8–12px → 0), duration 250–300ms, ease-out
- No opacity fade from 0 (text must remain readable)
- Hover cards: scale 1 → 1.03
- Buttons: smooth background transition to darker navy
- Links/icons: subtle color transition to darker navy
- Animations must be **calm and subtle**, professional, not flashy

9. RESPONSIVENESS
- Fully mobile responsive
- Headings and text scale for small screens
- Cards stack neatly on mobile
- Hover and motion effects reduce for mobile if necessary

10. FINAL CHECK
- All headings and body text clearly readable
- Dark navy is dominant accent color
- Cards and buttons interactive with navy hover effects
- Visual hierarchy consistent
- Spacing and padding feel comfortable and premium
- All sections maintain original content and order
- The site should look clean, modern, and professional like a premium SaaS landing page
